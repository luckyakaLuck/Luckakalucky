        <footer>I am a 10 year old Youtuber who does other things silently.
             The Bugdet ran out a long time ago and because due to crisis in me I cannot make youtube videos anymore.
             As of August 26th, the date I made this Page, I am slowing down on communications.
             But fear no more as of Sep - Oct, my Budget will soon increase and I will make weekly video's on Memes and such.
             I am not only a Youtuber, but also an experienced coder in Python and now knowing how to make html websites.
             I have a coding passion of making my very own app/website and this carrier started with me learning the bases of Scratch (IDK why i chose to do this first but did help me).
